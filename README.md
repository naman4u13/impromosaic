## Description
I have taken 6 blackboard images, clicked from different angles(different projective planes) and then stitched them together to 
create a single image.For this assignment, i have a taken one image as reference and then calculated a homography matrix using 
4 corresponding points for each image.There after transforming each image into projective plane of reference image ,i have eventually 
stitched it to reference image.
